- Buyer: Can view all products, add them to their cart, and proceed with purchases.
- Seller: Can list their products and accept payments once authorized.
- Admin: Has the authority to approve new sellers, after which they can start selling their products.

The project also includes integration with Razorpay for payment processing and supports email functionality for effective communication.
